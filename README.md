# Database_Server_Configuration
Our project involves the implementation of a comprehensive Learning Management System using Microsoft SQL Server to support hybrid course and training services. The system is designed to manage various aspects of the learning process, including course offerings, student enrollment, progress tracking, and resource management.

## Configuration
We've designed tables for storing course, student, and instructor data, along with views for customized data access. Triggers enforce data integrity, while stored procedures handle complex business logic. Indexes optimize query performance, and grants ensure proper security and access control.

## Source Code
All files are divided into six categories:
- tables
- views
- procedures
- triggers
- indexes
- grants
